title: "Guest Post on RubyLearning: Building DSLs with yield and instance_eval"
---

I recently wrote a guest post for the RubyLearning blog entitled ["How do I build DSLs with yield and instance_eval?"](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2010/11/30/how-do-i-build-dsls-with-yield-and-instance_eval/). It gives a brief overview of how to use Ruby to build simple internal DSLs. Enjoy!
