<div class="entry-content"><p>There have been tons of comparisons between Ruby and other languages (mostly Python) ranging from the <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonVsRuby">technical</a> to the <a href="http://blog.extracheese.org/2010/02/python-vs-ruby-a-battle-to-the-death.html">epically titled</a>. I&#8217;ve always felt that both languages are nice, but feel much more at home with the expressive, readable Ruby syntax. And don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love Ruby for all kinds of language reasons. Re-openable classes, blocks and the general meta-programming <span class="caps">DNA</span> of Ruby make it just wonderfully powerful and useful for me as a developer. However, when I think about it the language is really only half the story when it comes to why I love being a Ruby developer.</p>
<p style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 15px;"><a href='http://xkcd.com/442/' title='I Love The Lisp Chainsaw'><img src='http://img.skitch.com/20100427-nwyu72qkhxhking8626aeixkys.png' alt="XKCD The Future's Pretty Cool"/></a></p>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s inherent in the makeup of the language and those to whom it appeals or the &#8220;buck the mainstream&#8221; attitude of Rails&#8217;s opinionated-ness, Rubyists tend to take to new things like fish to water. An outsider may look at the insane progression of testing frameworks and other different-ways-to-do-the-same-thing and think it&#8217;s a kind of madness, sickness, or chaos. Well, I suppose it is. However, living inside the Ruby hurricane has helped me to grow as a developer more than I could possibly have imagined in the few years I&#8217;ve been doing it full time. Thanks to Ruby, I was on board with these technologies months or even years before I feel I otherwise would have been (just a few examples):</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Test-Driven Development:</strong> Already a mainstay in the Ruby community when I joined it, <span class="caps">TDD</span> has seen some pretty rapid expansion into other languages and communities. I&#8217;m not saying Ruby was the first or only, but it was certainly an early and strong <span class="caps">TDD</span> community.</li>
	<li><strong>Distributed Version Control:</strong> <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> is the future not only of project version control but of open-source collaboration. SourceForge by comparison seems like a lumbering dinosaur. Fork, fix, push.</li>
	<li><strong>NoSQL:</strong> I was playing with CouchDB about a year ago, not realizing that soon it would be a player in the biggest developer flamewar since Vim vs. Emacs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to say that X language doesn&#8217;t promote innovation or adoption of new ideas or Y has an inferior community. This isn&#8217;t a comparison post. I just know that when it comes to new technologies, most Rubyists I know are already jumping out of the plane while still trying to figure out how the parachute works. That sounds like an insult, but I think it&#8217;s amazing. We have a community of people so excited about technology that they literally can&#8217;t wait to build on it or for it, and share it with others. The huge proliferation of regional Ruby conferences speaks to this: we&#8217;re a group of people so intensely interested in learning about what&#8217;s new that we can&#8217;t manage holding just a few mainstream conferences each year.</p>
<p>For me, being a part of the Ruby community feels like getting a sneak peek at where software development is going six months to two years from now. That&#8217;s not to say it&#8217;s all rainbows and daisies&#8230;the constantly changing landscape requires a real passionate dedication to keep up or you&#8217;ll quickly fall behind, and not all technologies are meant to immediately be deployed to massive-scale production environments (restraint is a skill a good Rubyist must learn and exercise on a regular basis). But I love Ruby because I feel confident that I will be made aware of trends in software development long before I would otherwise be expected to understand them.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to live in the future.</p></div>
